**Admin Dashboard**

**Overview**

The Admin Dashboard is a React-based web application designed for managing users and roles in an organization. It provides an intuitive interface for administrators to view, edit, and delete users, manage roles and permissions, and configure system settings. With its professional and elegant design, the dashboard ensures usability, responsiveness, and scalability, making it a versatile tool for administrative tasks.

**Key Features
User Management:
**
View a list of all users with their roles and status.
Edit user information with a simple button click.
Delete users from the system seamlessly.

**Role Management:
**
Display all roles along with their permissions.
Define and assign roles to users with ease.

**Settings:**

Configure system preferences and security policies.
Professional UI/UX:

Elegant and modern design with responsive layouts.
Intuitive navigation bar and visually appealing card-based interface.
Responsive Design:

Fully responsive layout that adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
Hover Effects:

Low hover effects on the table rows and action buttons for a professional look.
**Key Implementations**
1. React Components
The project is structured with reusable React components for modularity and maintainability:
Dashboard.js: The main component displaying all sections of the dashboard.
FaIcons: Icons from react-icons are used for visual enhancements.
2. State Management
useState Hook:
Manages the state for users and roles.
Example:
const [users, setUsers] = useState([
  { id: 1, name: Manju", role: "Admin", status: "Active" },
  { id: 2, name: "Biju", role: "Editor", status: "Inactive" },
]);
3. CSS Styling
The Dashboard.css file defines the design elements:
Professional gradient background.
Responsive card layout with shadow and hover effects.
Custom table design with hover effects for rows and actions.
Stylish buttons for user actions like Edit and Delete.
4. Action Buttons
Edit Button:
Logs the selected user ID in the console (can be extended to open an edit form).
**Example:**
const handleEditUser = (id) => {
  console.log(`Editing user with ID: ${id}`);
};
**Delete Button:**
Removes the user from the users state array.
**Example:**

const handleDeleteUser = (id) => {
  setUsers(users.filter((user) => user.id !== id));
};
**5. User-Friendly Navigation**
Navigation bar includes options like Manage Users, Manage Roles, and Settings.
Smooth hover animations make navigation interactive and visually pleasing.
**6. Responsive Design**
CSS media queries ensure the dashboard is usable on mobile devices.
Example:

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .content {
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
  }
}
7. Error-Free Code
All React warnings, such as unused variables, are resolved.
Example:
Removed unused setRoles.
Logged the userToEdit variable for debugging:

console.log(`Editing user with ID: ${id}`);
File Structure
scss

â”œâ”€â”€ Component/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dashboard.js      // Main component for the admin dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Dashboard.css      // Styling for the admin dashboard
â”œâ”€â”€ App.js                // Entry point for React components
â””â”€â”€ index.js              // Main file for React rendering
How It Works
Rendering Users and Roles:

The dashboard renders user and role data from the state arrays using the map() function.
**Example:**
{users.map((user) => (
  <tr key={user.id}>
    <td>{user.name}</td>
    <td>{user.role}</td>
    <td>{user.status}</td>
    <td>
      <button onClick={() => handleEditUser(user.id)}>Edit</button>
    </td>
  </tr>
))}
**Dynamic Interactions:**

Edit and Delete actions trigger state updates, ensuring the UI reflects changes immediately.
Styling Enhancements:

Buttons and rows have hover effects to improve interactivity.
Cards and table rows use shadows and gradients for a clean design.
