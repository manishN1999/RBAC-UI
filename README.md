Key Implementations
1. **React Components**
The project is structured with reusable React components for modularity and maintainability:
Dashboard.js: The main component displaying all sections of the dashboard.
FaIcons: Icons from react-icons are used for visual enhancements.
2. **State Management**
useState Hook:
Manages the state for users and roles.
Example:
javascript
Copy code
const [users, setUsers] = useState([
  { id: 1, name: "Manish", role: "Admin", status: "Active" },
  { id: 2, name: "Brijendra", role: "Editor", status: "Inactive" },
]);
3. CSS Styling
The Dashboard.css file defines the design elements:
Professional gradient background.
Responsive card layout with shadow and hover effects.
Custom table design with hover effects for rows and actions.
Stylish buttons for user actions like Edit and Delete.
4. Action Buttons
Edit Button:
Logs the selected user ID in the console (can be extended to open an edit form).
5. User-Friendly Navigation
Navigation bar includes options like Manage Users, Manage Roles, and Settings.
Smooth hover animations make navigation interactive and visually pleasing.
